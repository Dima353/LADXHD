THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT. You can find the original location of it [here](https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd).
This repository merely exists to preserve it as an easily buildable copy, as the original source used a strange MonoGame layout.
I've provided a build artifact with the relevant `dotnet` version bundled, for easy usage of the project under `wine`, as that's how I would use it.

You can build it easily by cloning the repository and running the GitHub action provided.
The following commands process can be used to build that on Linux, assuming .NET 6.0 with the right target available:

```bash
winetricks d3dcompiler_47 dotnet6
dotnet tool restore
MGFXC_WINE_PATH=$WINEPREFIX dotnet publish -c Release -o <outdir>
```
